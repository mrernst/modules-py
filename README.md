# modules-py
A Modular Tensorflow Framework for Recurrent Neural Networks

Using modules-py you can easily stack together tensorflow neural networks similar to keras.sequential() 
However where modules-py is specially coded for recurrent processing, so modules can be stacked together at different timesteps.
